            "this lesson is some weird quirks of the HTML syntax. So something that a lot of beginners\n",
            "have trouble with is that in html, if you have multiple spaces\n",
            "like this, for example, if we save this file and we reload, you'll notice that all of these spaces\n",

            "learn how to deal with these situations, but for now, just keep this in mind. So let's get rid of these\n",
            "extra spaces for now. And another weird quirk of the\n",
            "syntax rule is that if I put my cursor here and I press enter to create\n",
            "a new line and I put my cursor here, again, these new lines\n",
            "also count as spaces, so the browser essentially ignores them. If I save the file and reload, you'll see\n",
            "that the new line doesn't do anything. So this actually makes organizing\n",
            "our HTML code very flexible. For example, if I wanted some more space between these\n",
            "elements so that it's easier to read in my code, I can just add as much spaces as I\n",
            "want and it won't get reflected in the website because extra spaces like\n",
            "these new lines are just ignored. A lot of people like to put the content\n",
            "of the element on its own line like this so that the tags basically align\n",

            "notice that this line is really long. We can actually add new lines here\n",
            "to make our code easier to read. So when we organize our code like this, we generally indent or add spaces in\n",
            "front of these lines. This helps us clearly tell the difference between\n",
            "the elements, tags and its contents. If we didn't have this indenting, then it's pretty hard to tell where\n",
            "this element starts and where it ends, especially when we have a lot of code. Now your indents might look\n",
            "a little different from mine. It might look something like this\n",
            "where you have more spaces than I do. This happens because by default vs.\n",
            "Code uses four spaces per indent. Generally in HTML and css,\n",

            "exactly as I have it here so that we're following the syntax rules for css. So let's save this file\n",
            "and refresh our page. And now you can see that we set the\n",
            "background color of the button to red. So as you can see, c s\n",
            "s is similar to H T M L. We're simply giving instructions to the\n",

            "sentences with a period in css, you end a style with a semicolon. So that's what all of this syntax means. So we can actually add multiple\n",
            "styles inside these brackets. So let's go ahead and add another style. We're going to change the text\n",

            "and we'll end it with as semicolon. Let's save and refresh. And now you can see that we change the\n",
            "text color of this button to white. And that's basically how c s s works. We tell the computer what we're targeting\n",
            "and then we give some styles and the computer is going to apply\n",
            "these styles one by one. So let's do another example. This\n",

            "I'm going to refresh and I think that\n",

            "step to get to our design. Next, we're going to adjust the width. So let's change this to\n",
